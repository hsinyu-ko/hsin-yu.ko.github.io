Hsin-Yu (silent H) is a computational physical chemist working with <u><a href="http://distasio.chem.cornell.edu/RAD.html">Robert A. DiStasio Jr.</a></u> at Cornell University.
He completed a Ph.D. in Theoretical Chemistry with <u><a href="https://chemistry.princeton.edu/faculty/car">Roberto Car</a></u> at Princeton University.
His research interests focus on the structures and reactive processes involving large-scale condensed-phase systems relevant to Energy, Environmental, and Materials Sciences
(e.g., molecular polymorphism in computational drug discovery and H<sub>3</sub>O<sup>+</sup>/OH<sup>-</sup> transport through confined aqueous in next-generation fuel cells).
To pursue these research topics, he works at the interface between Quantum Electronic Structure Theory, Statistical Mechanical Sampling, and High-Performance Computing/Machine-Learning Algorithms.
He is a long-term developer/co-author of the open-source <u><a href="https://www.quantum-espresso.org/">Quantum ESPRESSO</a></u> package.

<!-- He has developed a number of high-performance electronic structure algorithms (e.g., SeA) to enable routine use of hybrid DFT for large-scale condensed-phase systems containing more than 1,000 atoms. -->
<!-- In addition to theoretical/algorithmic developments, Hsin-Yu also applies machine-learning techniques to investigate condensed-phase systems with even more extended length- and time-scales to allow more realistic modeling towards mesoscopic experimental conditions. -->
