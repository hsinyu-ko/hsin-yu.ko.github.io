<!-- Hsin-Yu (silent "H" to heal the "sin")  -->
Hsin-Yu
is a Postdoctoral Research Associate in the Department of Chemistry and Chemical Biology at Cornell University.
He received B.S. with honor in chemistry from National Taiwan University in 2010.
During that time and shortly after military service, he worked with Professor Bih-Yaw Jin on modeling optical properties of molecular metamaterials.


Hsin-Yu started his graduate study in Theoretical Chemistry at Princeton University in 2012 with 
<u><a href="https://chemistry.princeton.edu/faculty/car">Professor Roberto Car</a></u>
on developing and applying *ab initio* molecular dynamics (AIMD) methods to understand molecular crystals, liquids, and aqueous systems.
<!--His <u><a href="https://www.proquest.com/openview/9a48bd8eb750a56fc9a0e88c052819ec/1?pq-origsite=gscholar&cbl=18750&diss=y">Ph.D. thesis</a></u> 
focused on using first-principles methods to study the structural and thermal properties of molecular crystals and liquids.-->
During his graduate research, Hsin-Yu became an active developer of the popular open-source planewave-pseudopotential package 
<u><a href="http://www.quantum-espresso.org/">Quantum ESPRESSO</a></u> for first-principles simulations of molecules and condensed-phase materials.
Besides research, Hsin-Yu emphasizes clear and effective mentorship; his undergraduate teaching was recognized by the 2016 Pickering Teaching Award.
After receiving his Ph.D. in early 2019, he worked as a postdoctoral researcher in the
<u><a href="https://ccsc.princeton.edu/">Chemistry in Solution and at Interfaces (CSI) Computational Chemical Science Center</a></u> at Princeton on using machine-learning potentials to extend the length and time scales of AIMD simulations.
In addition, he served as an early-career network (ECN) representative for the CSI center.

In late 2019, Hsin-Yu joined the group of <u><a href="http://distasio.chem.cornell.edu/RAD.html">Professor Robert A. DiStasio Jr.</a></u>
in the Department of Chemistry and Chemical Biology at Cornell University.
His research at Cornell focused on developing novel theoretical and high-performance computing algorithms to enable routine use of sophisticated dispersion-inclusive hybrid density functional theory (DFT) for large-scale condensed-phase systems.
He became a proud recipient of the 2021 NERSC Early Career Award for High Impact Scientific Achievement for his development in hybrid DFT.
He now works as a part of Cornell's <u><a href="https://cabes.cornell.edu/">Center for Alkaline-Based Energy Solutions (CABES) Energy Frontier Research Center (EFRC)</a></u>.
By combining hybrid DFT with machine-learning potentials, he is currently investigating the intelligent design of next-generation alkaline fuel cells---a promising route towards a clean and sustainable Low-Carbon Future.
