<!-- Hsin-Yu (silent "H" to heal the "sin")  -->
Hsin-Yu
is a Postdoctoral Research Associate in the Department of Chemistry and Chemical Biology at Cornell University.
He received B.S. with honor in chemistry from National Taiwan University in 2010.
During that time and shortly after military service, he worked with Professor Bih-Yaw Jin on modeling optical properties of molecular metamaterials.


Hsin-Yu started his graduate study in Theoretical Chemistry at Princeton University in 2012 with 
<u><a href="https://chemistry.princeton.edu/faculty/car">Professor Roberto Car</a></u>
on developing and applying *ab initio* molecular dynamics (AIMD) methods to understand molecular crystals and aqueous systems.
His <u><a href="https://www.proquest.com/openview/9a48bd8eb750a56fc9a0e88c052819ec/1?pq-origsite=gscholar&cbl=18750&diss=y">Ph.D. thesis</a></u> 
focused on using first-principles methods to study the structural and thermal properties of molecular crystals and liquids.
During his graduate research, Hsin-Yu became an active developer of the popular open-source planewave-pseudopotential package 
<u><a href="http://www.quantum-espresso.org/">Quantum ESPRESSO</a></u> for first-principles simulations of molecules and condensed-phase materials.
After receiving his Ph.D. in early 2019, he worked at as a postdoctoral research associate the Department of Energy (DOE) sponsored
<u><a href="https://ccsc.princeton.edu/">Chemistry in Solution and at Interfaces (CSI) Computational Chemical Science Center</a></u> at Princeton
on using machine-learning to extend the length and time scales of AIMD simulations and simultaneously served as the DOE early-career network (ECN) representative for the center.

During the late 2019, Hsin-Yu joined the group of <u><a href="http://distasio.chem.cornell.edu/RAD.html">Professor Robert A. DiStasio Jr.</a></u>
in the Department of Chemistry and Chemical Biology at Cornell University.
His research at Cornell focused on using developing novel theoretical and high-performance computing algorithms to enabled routine use of sophisticated dispersion-inclusive
hybrid density functional theory (DFT) for large-scale condensed-phase systems.
For this development, he became a proud recipient of the
<u><a href="https://www.nersc.gov/news-publications/nersc-news/nersc-center-news/2021/nersc-honors-eight-early-career-scientists-with-hpc-achievement-awards/">
2021 NERSC Early Career Award for High Impact Scientific Achievement.</a></u>
Based on this development and the machine-learning techniques developed at CSI, he worked as a part of the DOE-sponsored
<u><a href="https://cabes.cornell.edu/">Center for Alkaline-Based Energy Solutions (CABES) Energy Frontier Research Center (EFRC)</a></u> at Cornell
on studying the base-stability and transport properties of anion-exchange membrane---both are crucial elements on the alkaline fuel cell pathway
towards the sustainable Low-Carbon Future.
