It is my great honor to receive the 2021 NERSC HPC Award for High Impact Scientific Achievement.
I truly appreciate the instrumental roles NERSC has played in nearly all aspects of my research.
I am also tremendously grateful for Marcos Calegari Andrade's kind nomination even during his busiest time!
