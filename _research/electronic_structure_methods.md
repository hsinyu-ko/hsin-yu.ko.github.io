# O(N) Exact-Exchange Algorithms (exx)
</a>

By admixing a fraction of exact exchange (EXX), hybrid functionals reduce the self-interaction error in semilocal density functional theory (DFT) and thereby furnish a more accurate and reliable description of the underlying electronic structure in systems throughout biology, chemistry, physics, and materials science.
However, applicability of hybrid DFT in the treating complex condensed-phase materials remains rather limited due to the high computational cost associated with the evaluation of the necessary EXX-related quantities.

In this work, we overcome this limitation via a linear-scaling approach that uses a local representation of the occupied orbitals (e.g., maximally localized Wannier functions (MLWFs)) to exploit the sparsity in the real-space evaluation of the quantum mechanical exchange interaction in finite-gap systems.
Our effort has yield a massively parallel (hybrid MPI/OpenMP) implementation (exx) in the open-source Quantum ESPRESSO package.
We found that this implementation is highly efficiently high-performance computing (HPC) resources available on current- and next-generation supercomputer architectures.
With sufficient HPC resources, we demonstrated that exx enables hybrid DFT-based *ab initio* molecular dynamics (AIMD) simulations of condensed-phase systems containing 500â€“1000 atoms (e.g., (H2O)256) with a wall time cost that is comparable to that of semilocal DFT.
As such, exx takes us one step closer to routinely performing AIMD simulations of complex and large-scale condensed-phase systems for sufficiently long time scales at the hybrid DFT level of theory.
